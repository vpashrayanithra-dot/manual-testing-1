# Manual Testing Project – Module 1

## Project Summary  
This repository contains a self-driven manual testing project  where I practised end-to-end manual testing on a demo or sample web application.  
The focus was on understanding test design, test case creation, execution, and documenting results to build solid foundational QA skills.

## Objectives  
- Learn how to write structured test cases based on basic functionality.  
- Cover different types of test scenarios including positive, negative, and edge cases.  
- Execute these test cases manually in a browser environment.  
- Document test execution outcomes and prepare a simple test summary report.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Test Case Documentation: Excel / Google Sheets  
- Browser: Google Chrome  
- File Types: X PDF, PNG  
- Testing Types:  
  - Functional Testing  
  - Negative Testing  
  - Exploratory Testing  

## Repository Structure  
```
/TestCases         – Test case documentation  
/Screenshots       – Screenshots taken during testing  
/Reports           – Test summary or observations  
```

## Test Approach  
1. Analysed the application’s basic workflow.  
2. Designed test cases covering positive, negative, and edge situations.  
3. Executed the test cases in the browser.  
4. Recorded results and observations.  

## Key Learnings  
- Stronger command of manual testing basics.  
- Better clarity in writing test cases and documenting results.  
- Improved analytical ability through exploratory testing.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add bug reports for any defects found.  
- Expand testing to additional modules.  
- Include UI/Usability test cases.
